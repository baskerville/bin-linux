# Description:
#
#	This program is intended to be used as a filter ahead of a mail
#	reader's pager, for example as the display_filter for mutt.  It
#	shortens To and Cc lists longer than two lines, replacing the
#	second and subsequent lines with
#
#		[<lines> lines deleted]
#
#	indicating the number of lines deleted.  It also removes excess
#	spaces at the ends of all lines of the message, but preserves
#	the trailing space of the signature's "-- " line.
#
# Revision History:
#
#	18 Nov. 2003 - Allow the lower-case header field names "to" and
#		       "cc" generated by some MUAs.  Patch contributed
#		       by Aseem Asthana.
#
#	27 Mar. 2002 - Truncates lines in To: and Cc: lists longer than
#		       $COLUMNS.
#
#	25 Jan. 2002 - Detects mutt's "weed" state by checking for
#		       "^From " on the first line and if not weeding,
#		       does not filter To and Cc lists.
#
#	27 Nov. 2001 - No longer removes trailing space from
#		       sigdashes ("^-- $").
#
# The latest version is available at
#
#	http://www.spocom.com/users/gjohnson/mutt/mail-to-filter
